\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{introduction}}

City Bike is the social company of New York City in charge to develop a
more suitable, helthier and eco-friendly transport through the use of
bikes. The project started in 2011 but its public appeared was in 2013
and thanks to the amazing and positive reception from the public we have
been growing not only in numbers of users but also in bikes and area
covered for the service. This report shows a glimpse of our data set for
2018, although is a sample we think we are able to get some conclusions
in order to improve the business

\hypertarget{what-we-offer}{%
\subsubsection{What we offer}\label{what-we-offer}}

we offer a diverse range of options tailored to different
necessities.From an Annual Membership with unlimited rides of 45 minutes
max to single ride of 30 minutes or a day pass (24 hours and unlimited
30 minutes rides). Obviously the prices are slightly different,and
always there will be an increment of the final fee if the time is
overtaken.

conclusions}\label{how-is-our-service-from-a-sample-registered-in-2018-what-can-we-learn-from-it-recommendations-conclusions}}

Dates shows that most of our users and subscribers are male. we should
ask why the quantity of women is much less, possible internal factors
from our service as the kind of bike(weight, color, area covered, basket
or transport kids), external factors, like the traffic, different ways
of journey.

\hypertarget{how-are-our-clients}{%
\subsubsection{How are our clients}\label{how-are-our-clients}}

what do we want? attarct customers, user experience. at what time our
service is more used?

do we want increase the number of bikes for area no more than 30 minutes
between stations, growth the number of bikes or area covered

\hypertarget{question}{%
\subsubsection{Question?}\label{question}}

Bikes is for sharing so obviusly there will be extra fees if the time is
overtaken prices : Day pass 24H 15 dollars, Annual Membership is 15\$
monthly or 185!dollars if billed upfront annually and 3.50 dollars for a
single ride
