backpack
```
Question 1.

Load in the libraries you need, and look at the backpack data. Take note of variable names and dimensions.
```{r}
names(backpack)
```
```{r}
dim(backpack)
```



Question 2.

What is the distribution of backpack weights that students are carrying? Choose an appropriate graph to show the distribution.


Backpacks weight distribution by major

```{r}
backpack %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = major , y = backpack_weight, fill = major), stat = 'identity')+
  labs(x= 'Backpack_weight',
       y = 'Major',
       title = 'Backpack_weigth by Major',
       subtitle = 'Daily University')+
  geom_col(position = 'dodge')+
  coord_flip()
  
  
```


```{r}
backpack %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = major, y = backpack_weight))+
  geom_point(aes(colour = major, shape = sex), size = 4)+
  labs(x= 'Backpack_weight',
       y = 'Major',
       title = 'Backpack_weigth by sex',
       subtitle = 'Daily University')+
  coord_flip()
```
This distribution is by major and sex




Question 3.
Are there differences in backpack weight between sex?

```{r}
backpack %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sex , y = backpack_weight), stat = 'identity')+
  labs(x= 'sex',
       y = 'Backpack_weight',
       title = 'Backpack_weigth by sex',
       subtitle = 'Daily University')+
  geom_col(position = 'dodge',fill = 'light blue')
```

The data shows that male carry more backpack weight than female.
Note: However, if it is eliminated inside "geo_col" the 'position' the result is different.





Question 4.

What is the relationship between body weight and backpack weight?
```{r}
backpack %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= body_weight , y = backpack_weight)) +
  labs(x = 'Body_weigth', y = 'backpack_weigth',title= 'Relations')+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16,face = "bold")) +
  labs(x= 'Body_weigth',
       y = 'Backpack_weight',
       title = 'Backpack_weigth by Body_weigth',
       subtitle = 'Daily University')+
  geom_point(colour = "Purple",show.legend = FALSE)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

There is not a relation, as heavy is a person no necessary carry more backpack_weigth

Question 5.

Is this relationship different between men and women? Choose an appropriate plot and interpret your findings.

```{r}
backpack %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= body_weight , y = backpack_weight)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16,face = "bold")) +
  labs(x= 'Body_weight',
       y = 'Backpack_weight',
       title = 'Relation Body/Backpack weight',
       subtitle = 'Daily University')+
  geom_point(aes(shape = sex,show.legend = FALSE), colour = "purple")+
  coord_flip()
```

The table shows that the body-weight is concentrate around 125lb and 175lb, and it is unclear a specific relation between the sex's weight and weight that this person can carry


Question 6.
What proportion of students report back pain?

```{r}
backpack %>% 
group_by(status) %>%
 summarise(counts = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = counts , y = 'back_problems' , fill = 'coral'), stat = 'identity') +
  geom_col(aes(show.legend = FALSE))
  
```



Question 7.

Is this proportion different between men and women?





Question 8.

Now youâ€™ve investigated your data separately, create plots to describe the relationship between backpack weight, body weight, gender and reported backpain.

Try both backpack_weight and body_weight as well as the ratio.

Hint: faceting would be useful here.
